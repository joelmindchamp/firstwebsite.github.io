<font size="4" color="white"> One of the less covered aspects of the nationalist struggle for Catalonian independence is the fact that the left, for the most part, does not support ousted President Carles Puigdemont.

Puigdemont leads a minority centre right Government that has been steadily losing popularity. His Junts pel SÃ­ party is itself a coalition of factions from the far left to the Christian right. It is propped up by the CUP, a left nationalist party that is the smallest in the Catalan Parliament.</font>
